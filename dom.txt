Document Object Model (DOM)
When the browser reads HTML code, whenever it encounters an HTML element like html, body, div etc., 
it creates a JavaScript object called a Node. Eventually, all HTML elements will be converted to JavaScript objects.

A DOM node doesn’t always have to be an HTML element. 
When the browser creates a DOM tree, it also saves things like comments, attributes, text as separate nodes in the tree.

JavaScript doesn’t understand what DOM is, it is not part of the JavaScript specifications. 
DOM is a high-level Web API provided by the browser to efficiently render a webpage and expose it publically 
for the developer to dynamically manipulate DOM elements for various purposes.

<html> -> HTMLHtmlElement

    <head> -> HTMLHeadElement

        <title> -> HTMLTitleElement

        <link> -> HTMLLinkElement

    <body> -> HTMLBodyElement

        <div> -> HTMLDivElement

            <h1> -> HTMLHeadingElement

                (Text Node)

            <p> -> HTMLParagraphElement

                (Text Node)

        <script> -> HTMLScriptElement



Styling

After constructing the DOM, the browser reads CSS from all the sources (external, embedded, inline, user-agent, etc.) 
and construct a CSSOM. CSSOM stands for CSS Object Model which is a Tree Like structure just like DOM.
Each node in this tree contains CSS style information that will be applied to DOM elements that it target (specified by the selector). 
CSSOM, however, does not contain DOM elements which can’t be printed on the screen like <meta>, <script>, <title> etc.
As we know, most of the browser comes with its own stylesheet which is called as user agent stylesheet, the browser first computes 
final CSS properties for DOM element by overriding user agent styles with CSS provided by the developer properties (using specificity rules) 
and then construct a node.

CSSOM -> DOM

DOM + CSSOM-> Render Tree

Since in CSSOM, p element situated inside div has display:none; style set on it, it and its children won’t be present in Render-Tree, 
since it occupies no space on the screen. However, if you have elements with visibility:hidden or opacity:0, 
they will occupy space on the screen hence they will be present in the Render-Tree.
